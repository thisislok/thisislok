###  What this includes:
- This was a group project of final 4 days of Mthree Tech Training course.
- We built a front-end React application for users to search for current and forecast weather results, using connection via FastAPI to back-end Python script where data is fetched from weatherAPI.com (free weather API source).
- We also added a connection to an Azure SQL database where the log of locations searched for is saved and can be queried.

###  Tech Stack:
Python | SQL | React(JavaScript & CSS) | Git | Jira
