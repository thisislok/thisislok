# Hiya, this is Lok!

 When I was eight, my dad brought home a retired Apple IIe computer from the high school where he taught. My mum wasn’t thrilled. She called it a 20 lbs old junk and worried it might crush me if it tipped over. She wanted it gone. Luckily, my dad kept it. I was instantly obsessed, started learning Integer BASIC and spent hours messing around with text games, amazed that a few lines of code could build puzzles, logic, even whole worlds. That early curiosity never really left me.
 
 **Cloud Developer** with a background in business development and a passion for building secure, scalable, and automated systems in the cloud. I recently completed the Generation UK&I Cloud Engineering Bootcamp and hold certifications in **Azure (AZ-900, SC-900)**, **Google Cybersecurity**, and **(ISC)² CC**.

I bring hands-on experience in **Terraform, Docker, MySQL, Python, Bash, and Azure**, and I thrive at the intersection of technical problem-solving, fast-paced learning, and strong communication.
